## Amount of Boards

There is one Board all Petitcode members should use to get a transparent view which member is working on which task : 

- Link to this Board here :  

With the shortcut "Q" you can toggle away other members' tickets so only your own are shown.

For private use you can of course make as much as you want, but trello is limited by group!

## Tickets 


  **Tickets in Trello should have the following content:**
  
  * Customer (which customer the ticket is related to / internal)
  * Description of the specified task of the ticket in user's view
  * Members (who is necessary on this ticket, NOT MORE!!!!)
  * Priority (High, Low, None)
  * Details and Technical Information (links to other boards etc, how to test, Techstacks)
	
Please take care of your tickets and treat them conscientiously!


**TODO LINE** : There should be a maximum of 2 tickets per user in this line

**IN PROGRESS**: There should be only 1 ticket per user in this line
