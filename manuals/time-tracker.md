# Using Time Tracker

No need to create an account as it is the same as Nextcloud.

To use Time Tracker properly, you simply need to follow these steps:

1) Create Client
2) Create Project
3) Start timing your work


You can find Time Tracker on the top menu bar at the far right (next to the money sack), or under this link: https://nextcloud.petitcode.com/index.php/apps/timetracker/

This will be done once a project has been signed and has become legally binding.
You can create new clients by clicking on "Clients" on the lefthanded side menu.

## Create Project

![Create Project](/uploads/guy-pic-uploads/create-project.png "Create Project")

Depending on your responsability on the project, this will be called "Design: Conception" "Dev - Backend"  etc
You can create new clients by clicking on "Projects" on the lefthanded side menu.

## Start timing your work

![Start Timing](/uploads/guy-pic-uploads/start-timing.png "Start Timing")

Go to "Timer" on the side bar menu. On the search field, give a name to the task you are about to perform and press the green "play" button at the right.
You can then link this timed activity to a specific project.

If you have followed this structure, the project will be linked to the specific client.
