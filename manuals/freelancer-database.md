# Freelancer Database

Since we are switching from Bullhorn to Excel until we develop/find the most suitable solution, here is a manual on how to use the database we have so far.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nWvvdffUEcgqbmuikiMb7WSmO_EX3T7TZ68ojaXkW4A/edit#gid=0

## Adding Candidates

The Database is main to be kept fairly simple. When adding new freelancers, make sure to confirm the seniority/quality with Seb or Otti beforehand. Once approved, fill in the following rows respectively:

* Name / Surname
* Role
* Skills
* Contacts (website + email + tel)
* Location
* CV


#### Role

ex: Front End Dev / Back End Dev / Mobile Dev / UI Designer / UI & UX Designer / Online Marketing / Social Media 


#### Skills

**this is critical for us to be able to search and find the right people when needed** - please add every detail found in CV

if related to Development - write every programming language, tools, frameworks

if related to Design - ex: InDesign, Photoshop, Adobe, Sketch. If designers also have front ent dev skills - write them down!

#### CV

Please add the respective CV under the following Nextcloud link: https://nextcloud.petitcode.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Petitcode-Documents/Freelance%20Network/CVs&fileid=5067
So far, the main Folder "CVs" has 3 Subfolders, so please copy the file in the appropriate subfolder:
- Design
- Software Dev
- PM : for Product and Project Management


Then:
- right-click on the CV 
- click on details
- Sharing
- click on the + sign. Then, a pop-down menu will appear **and a "copy link" icon on the left**
- copy the file link and paste it on Excel. This will avoid anyone having to look for the specific CV on Nextcloud every time.


## Searching for Candidates

You can:

a) Ctrl + F : type any word (skill or role) to find all relevant results. This is the recommended approach, as you will search all fields simultaneously.

b) Align Column E (Role) or any other of your interest from A to Z.


Happy findings.
