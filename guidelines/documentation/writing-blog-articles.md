# Writing Blog Articles

Always refer to this Trello board: https://trello.com/b/cSeNuBLV/seo-blogging-online-marketing

One card per article. Please post all your KW research on the Word doc, together with your text.
When done, shift the card to Revision and briefly write Guy on slack about it.


Any topic should be researched in terms of Volume of Searches (Traffic) and Volume of Results (Competition). The higher the traffic, the better. The lower the competition, the better.

## How to write

Writing content isn't just simply writing.

After choosing a topic to write a piece of content about, make sure you use the provided free keyword tools to research what ranks better.

Once you have enough data to choose a keyword (KW), make sure you repeat the exact KW in your Title, H1, H2 (2x), H3 (if applicable - 3x), normal Text and Alt Text for any images.

FYI: Each KW has variation terms that are related to the main KW. Determining the exact Variation Terms for each KW requires a professional tool. However, you will have to adapt the KW throughout the text accordingly (ex: so the gramar/context makes sense) so don't worry too much about this.

Just write.
