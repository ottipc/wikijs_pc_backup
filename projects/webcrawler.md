# Webcrawler

## Specification

We want to implement a webcrawler which scan the Internet for webpages and analyse the used Technologies. After manual validation of this Technologies, we want to make the customer an offer for a new Webpage constructed by Petitcode.
Petitcode here needs some Infomrationen by the scan which is really necessary :

- Customer name
- Technologies used at actual Webpage
- Contact Person of the potential Customer


## Technical Details


## Crawler workflow 
1. Scan specified Sites
2. Send Emai to petitcode employes with found Data
3. Eventually save all related to a Database ( if we want to scan a lot of sides, it will be a lot of data, so we have to decide if this is necessary) 
## Important
* Customers only should note on for one time. If he is explicitly answering, that he dont want a homepage, it is forbidden to notify the customer twice.
* Are we are permitted to save data we use from google? I think not
* Where we getting urls we are scanning?
* Which Technics we should use
